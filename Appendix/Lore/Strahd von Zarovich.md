>Professor Strahd von Zarovich was a professor, a prince, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, the warlord Vlad Tepes, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Țepeș Vodă - or "Prince Tepes" in memory of his father.
>
>Queen Justina lamented the death of her husband, and was fearful of her stepson Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his stepmother visited upon his brother, so he remained in Romania. 
>
>But age caught up with Strahd, and, fearful that he'd meet the same fate as his father due to his dulling reactions, he scoured Europe for wise priests and occultists alike, desperately searching for the secret to eternal youth. His quest led him to the shores of Britain, where he'd heard of renowned universities that would allow him to continue on his blasphemous quest.
>
>Whilst studying at Oxford, Strahd's goals became murkier. He made contact with _Something_, and that Something called him to meet with the Strigoi that dwelled in St Paul's Cathedral. He travelled down and made a pact with the Strigoi; a pact that would define not only Strahd's existence, but the fate of London.

>At roughly the same time another student - a young Romanian girl - caught his eye. Tatyana; a woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. She soon had his full attention, and he believed he would wed her. He lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention, and when they both graduated and she announced that she would be staying in London, he also moved there, deciding to build a castle that he named after his family home: Severndroog.
> 
>Strahd insisted that his mother and brother move to Britain as well to stay with him, as some relatives of their old enemies had begun forming alliances in Romania. They accepted. Sergei eventually took up residence at Severndroog Castle, but Justinia passed away while travelling to their new home. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed her body in a crypt beneath the castle.
>
>Despite Strahd's prior efforts, Tatyana did not return his feelings; instead she fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realised he'd been a fool. He murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the pact he made with Strigoi.
>
>He then chased Sergei's bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death.
>
>Castle guards, seeing the atrocity their master had become and seeing an opportunity to rid the world of this evil forever, shot their master with arrows. But Strahd did not die. Strigoi honoured the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red.
>
>After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father, stepmother, and brother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed his family bloodline.
>
>Strahd has been the master of Severndroog for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts - none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them, he turned into vampire spawn. Though he feeds on the hapless souls of London, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to London, to rid the world of his blight.
