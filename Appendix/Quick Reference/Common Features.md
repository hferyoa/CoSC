# Secret Doors
If there are obvious clues to a secret door's presence, such as scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading do it, a character with a Spot Hidden score of 60 or higher notices the secret door. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area with a difficult Spot Hidden check.

# Locks
A character or creature with experience using Locksmith tools can use them to pick a typical lock with a successful difficult Locksmith check.

Alternatively, a typical padlock can be smashed with a bludgeoning implement and an extreme Strength check.

# Webs
Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without fear of being restrained or slowed down - but they do obscure vision very quickly. A character can clear away the cobwebs from a 10 foot square as an action. Webs woven by giant spiders are a different matter.
