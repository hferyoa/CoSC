> 1| A plush werewolf stuffed with sawdust and tiny wood-carved babies. It has dull knife blades for claws and retractable teeth.
> 2| A smiling jester marionette with tangled strings and tiny copper balls sewn into its cap.
> 3| A wooden puzzle box, 6 inches on a side, carved with silhouettes of leering clown faces. The box rattles when shaken. An investigator who spends time fiddling with the box can figure out how to open it with an extreme INT check. The box is empty, with nothing inside to explain the rattling. The check can be rerolled at any point during downtime, but each attempt takes an hour.
> 4| A faceless doll in a wedding dress that has yellowed and frayed with age.
> 5| A vaguely coffin-shaped jack-in-the-box containing a pop-up Strahd puppet.
> 6| A spring-loaded set of wooden teeth with fangs, all painted white. The teeth gnash and chatter for 1 minute when the spring is wound tight and released.

# Crawling Zombie
> [!cite]- Narrator
> You hear guttural groans from close to the floor in the blackness ahead. Initially, you believe this to be some kind of aggressive beast, but you quickly realise it's a man whose legs and lower torso have recently been severed. The man is dragging himself on exhausted arms, his intestines spilling out into a slug-like trail behind him. Seeing you, his gormless expression turns into a death-groan, and the man expires.
