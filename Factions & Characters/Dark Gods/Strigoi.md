> [!cite] Pact
>*In the depths where light has fled,*  
>*I dwell among the ancient dead.*  
>*I see your heart, your secret fear,*  
>*And offer you what you revere.*
>
>*First, you must take a life that cares,*  
>*A heart bound to you through love it bears.*
>*Their blood, still warm, you'll drink in haste,*  
>*And seal the bond with death’s dark taste.*
>
>*Second must be a cherished soul,*
>*To hear death's unrelenting toll.*
>*Their death you'll cause; a work of art,*
>*To be reborn, yet lost to heart.*
>
>*Finally, your own end must be,*  
>*By those who hate, who long to see,*  
>*Your blood spilled out in violent strife,*  
>*The cost of your immortal life.*
>
>*Through these deeds, the pact has been made,*  
>*Soul for shadow, a life to fade.*  
>*In darkness deep, you’ll rise anew,*  
>*Eternal night, your path to view.*
>
>*As kin of mine, you’ll walk the night,*  
>*Forsaking day, avoiding light.*  
>*No mortal binds shall hold you tight,*  
>*Immortal now, in endless flight.*
>
>*So take my offer, if you dare,*  
>*Embrace the void, beyond despair.*  
>*Your soul is mine, your life I’ll twist,*  
>*In the abyss, forever kissed.*
