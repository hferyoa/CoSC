- Gulthias Staff
- Located within Charlton House in Greenwich
- Made from the branch of the Charlton House Hackberry Tree, the Charlton Staff, or Nettletree Cane is a black and twisted cane
- Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30ft of it
- If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300ft
- All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die
- The staff can be wielded as a magical quarterstaff
- On a hit it deals damage as normal, and you can choose to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon
	- Each time a charge is spent, fresh blood oozes from the cane's pores, and you must succeed on a ==sanity throw or be afflicted with short term madness==
- While using the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them
