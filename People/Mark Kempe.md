# Roleplaying Mark
- Mark is a young alcoholic man, whom the other townsfolk often call "Kempe the Lesser" because he has lived in the shadow of his father his whole life.
- Mark isn't a typically dour Londoner. Through slurred, cheerful speech, he invites the investigators to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in [[Healing Irene Kempe|healing]] his sister, [[Irene Kempe|Irene]].
