1. Billy's Brewery
	- Bildrath's Mercantile
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> The sparse light from this building spills out from behind heavy drawn curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads "Billy's Brewery".
	- The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The owner, [[Billy Cantwell]] sells [[$basic items]], for ten times the advertised price.
	- Billy trades with the [[Factions & Characters/The Ravens/About|Ravens]] whenever they're in town. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says:
		> [!cite] Billy Cantwell
		> If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it.
	- He has no competition in the town.
	- If the characters give Billy a hard time, he calls [[Parry Wimple]], his nephew and stock-boy, to help him out. Parry's muscles rippling beneath his boiler suit should give ample notice of the boy's strength. At the same time, Parry's simple-minded. He is devoted to his mother, and by proxy, her brother Billy.
2. Brewery Basement
	- Blood of the Vine Tavern
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> As you round the corner of the building named Billy's Brewery, a shaft of light pierces through the fog to illuminate a cracked door hanging from its hinges on the side of the building. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Brewery Basement. Peering through the doorway, a set of cracked concrete stairs lead down to the underbelly of the building hidden in darkness.
	- A speakeasy owned by Billy, masquerading as a museum of the old brewery from before Prohibition times.
	- The tavern is likewise 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddles souls within. They include the barkeep, three Ravens sitting together, and a man named [[Mark Kempe]] - who happens to be the son of the Mayor, [[Colin Kempe]].
3. Mad Mary's Townhouse
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> A moaning sob floats through the still, grey streets, colouring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.
	- The house, which is about 40 feet square, is boarded up and barricaded from the inside.
	- Mad Mary sits in the centre of the floor in an upstairs bedroom, clutching a malformed doll. She is lost in her sorrow and despondency.
		- The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress. It belonged to Mary in her youth and was passed down to Gertruda.
		- [[Waldorf Bassett]], the Toymaker of London, made the doll. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "If it's not fun, it's not a Bassett!"
	- She barely recognises the presence of anyone in the room.
	- She says nothing in the presence of anger, but she will talk, albeit haltingly, to someone who talks with her gently.
	- Mary hid her beloved daughter, Gertruda, in this house for the girl's entire life. Gertruda, now a teenager, broke out of the house a week ago and has not been seen since. Mary fears the worst.
4. Mayor's Mansion
	- Burgomaster's Mansion
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself.Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the domain.
