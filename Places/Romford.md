1. Billy's Brewery
	- Bildrath's Mercantile
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> The sparse light from this building spills out from behind heavy drawn curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads "Billy's Brewery".
	- The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The owner, [[Billy Cantwell]] sells [[$basic items]], for ten times the advertised price.
	- Billy trades with the [[Factions & Characters/The Ravens/About|Ravens]] whenever they're in town. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says:
		> [!cite] Billy Cantwell
		> If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it.
	- He has no competition in the town.
	- If the characters give Billy a hard time, he calls [[Parry Wimple]], his nephew and stock-boy, to help him out. Parry's muscles rippling beneath his boiler suit should give ample notice of the boy's strength. At the same time, Parry's simple-minded. He is devoted to his mother, and by proxy, her brother Billy.
2. Brewery Basement
	- Blood of the Vine Tavern
	> [!cite] Narrator
	> As you round the corner of the building named Billy's Brewery, a shaft of light pierces through the fog to illuminate a cracked door hanging from its hinges on the side of the building. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Brewery Basement. Peering through the doorway, a set of cracked concrete stairs lead down to the underbelly of the building hidden in darkness.
	- A speakeasy owned by Billy, masquerading as a museum of the old brewery from before Prohibition times.
	- The tavern is likewise 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddles souls within. They include the barkeep, three Ravens sitting together, and a man named [[Mark Kempe]] - who happens to be the son of the Mayor, [[Colin Kempe]].
