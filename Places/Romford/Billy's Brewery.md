- Bildrath's Mercantile

> The sparse light from this building spills out from behind heavy drawn curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads "Billy's Brewery".
- The establishment is 70 feet long by 40 feet wide. The owner, [[Billy Cantwell]] sells [[$basic items]], for ten times the advertised price.
- Billy trades with the [[Factions & Characters/The Ravens/About|Ravens]] whenever they're in town. He is also happy to make a profit from any strangers unlucky enough to find themselves here. He serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains since, as he says:

> If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it.
- He has no competition in the town.
- If the characters give Billy a hard time, he calls [[Parry Wimple]], his nephew and stock-boy, to help him out. Parry's muscles rippling beneath his boiler suit should give ample notice of the boy's strength. At the same time, Parry's simple-minded. He is devoted to his mother, and by proxy, her brother Billy.
