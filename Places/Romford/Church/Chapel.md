> The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.

> From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man's voice cry out:
>> [!cite] Doran
>> Father! I'm starving!
- [[Father Donaghan|Donaghan]] has been praying throughout the night. His voice is hoarse and weak. He is, in a word, insane. A little more than a year ago, his twenty-year old son Doran and several other civilians attacked a [[Factions & Characters/The Ravens/About|Ravens' Nest]] in revolt against the terror they've brought to Londoners. By all accounts, the group fell at the hands of the Ravens, and Doran reached [[Strahd von Zarovich|the Professor himself]], who turned the boy in to a vampyr spawn and sent him back to his father as a message against those who would rise up against him in future. Donaghan was able to trap his son in the church's undercroft, where he remains to this day.
- Doran hasn't fed since he was imprisoned, and cries out to his father at all hours. Meanwhile, Donaghan prays day and night, hoping that God will tell him how to save Doran without destroying him. If the investigators seem intent on slaying Doran, Donaghan does his best to stop them. If Doran dies, Donaghan falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair.
- In addition to the lore known to all Londoners, Donaghan knows the following useful information:
	- [[Irene Kempe|Irene]] is not the natural daughter of [[Colin Kempe|Colin]]. Though it has been kept a secret even to Irene herself, Colin found her at the edge of Epping Forest. She was but a young girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. Colin adopted her and loved her dearly.
	- Every night at midnight, spirits of the dead interred within the cemetery rise from the ground and begin walking as a procession towards London.
- The chapel will be visited as part of the [[Funeral for Mayor Colin]] quest.
