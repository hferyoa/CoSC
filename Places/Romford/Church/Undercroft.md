> The church's undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips through the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.
- The shape is Doran, a vampyr spawn, sent by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to torment [[Father Donaghan]] and cast down the church. Doran is starved for blood and brave enough to attack a lone character. If the characters approach as a group, he does his best to avoid them while hissing:

> [!cite] Doran
> I can smell your blood! Leave before I can't control myself!
- If the investigators cut off his escape, he lunges forth out of the shadows and attacks. Any investigator who hasn't witnessed a vampyr spawn before and sees the boy as he leaves the shadows for the first time must make a 2/1d8 sanity check. This is lowered to 1/1d4 if Donaghan has advised the party that his son has been turned to a vampyr.
- If the investigators restrain Doran and either promise him blood or threaten to destroy him, or if they somehow kill and then raise him from the dead, he recounts the events that led to his downfall.
- If the [[2. Fortuna|Fortune Telling]] reveals that a treasure is in the undercroft, it's contained in a mouldy, old chest in the southwest corner of the room. The chest is unlocked and not trapped.
