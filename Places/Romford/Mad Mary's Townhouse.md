> A moaning sob floats through the still, grey streets, colouring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.
- The house, which is about 40 feet square, is boarded up and barricaded from the inside.
- Mad Mary sits in the centre of the floor in an upstairs bedroom, clutching a malformed doll. She is lost in her sorrow and despondency.
	- The malformed doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress. It belonged to Mary in her youth and was passed down to Gertruda.
	- [[Waldorf Bassett]], the Toymaker of London, made the doll. Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "If it's not fun, it's not a Bassett!"
- She barely recognises the presence of anyone in the room.
- She says nothing in the presence of anger, but she will talk, albeit haltingly, to someone who talks with her gently.
- Mary hid her beloved daughter, Gertruda, in this house for the girl's entire life. Gertruda, now a teenager, broke out of the house a week ago and has not been seen since. Mary fears the worst.
