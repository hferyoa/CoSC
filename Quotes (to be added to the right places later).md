```
A gust of air like the foul-smelling breath of some horrible monster greets the party as they climb the steps of a tower in Severndroog Castle. Nearing the top, they begin to hear the beating of a heart in the darkness above.
```

```
When it seems as though the characters have everything under control, you can have a gust of wind suddenly blow out their torches, plunging them into darkness
```

```
Before a monster appears, take a moment to describe the odor that precedes it, the eerie sound it makes, or the weird shadow it casts.
```

```
Before characters encounter a monster, hint at the monster's presence with clues such as claw marks, gnawed bones, and bloodstains.
```

```
Whenever characters take a long rest, give one character a prophetic dream in which he or she glimpses something yet to be found or encountered.
```

```
Take time to describe the rotting timbers of buildings, the faded and moth-eaten clothing of the Barovian peasantry, the worm-ridden pages of old books, and the rust on iron fences and gates.
```

```
A character gazing into a mirror, a pool, or other reflective surface might glimpse an older, more decrepit version of himself or herself.
```

```
In a land as dreary as Barovia, take the time to describe the occasional scene of beauty, such as a pretty flower growing atop a grave.
```

```
Make sure that the heroes have contact with NPCs who are honest, friendly, and helpful, such as the Martikovs in Vallaki or the Krezkovs in Krezk.
```

```
A groaning house, the wailing wind, grasping mud, and a squatting chest aren't just mundane thingsâ€”they're characters in your story, made all the creepier thanks to their humanlike traits. Torches sputter nervously, rusty hinges shatter silence with their sudden cries of anguish, and cobwebs quietly beckon us to our doom.
```

```
Imagine darkness as a silent crowd that follows the characters everywhere and stares at them while they sleep.
```

```
Imagine trees as towering giants that stand idle yet ever watchful as characters face the perils of the Svalich Woods alone.
```

```
In a given encounter area, choose one object or feature to describe in some detail. It need not be important to the story.
```

```
Allow the character who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score to see, hear, or smell something that no one else can perceive.
```

```
Allow NPCs (even evil ones) to tell jokes, speak in a funny voice, or behave idiotically. Even morbid humor is better than none.
```

```
When a hero, villain, or monster rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, describe a humorous mishap that occurs as a result of the low roll, such as a character accidentally knocking over a lamp and setting some drapes on fire while trying to hide or move silently.
