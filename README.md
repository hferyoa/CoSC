Enclosed within this folder structure are my notes on running a Curse of Strahd game within Call of Cthulhu.

Unlike in 5e Curse of Strahd, there are no heroes of this tale. The players will play as investigators, but their investigation will quickly turn to that of a hunter/hunted scenario that they must survive at all costs.
