>[!cite] <u>Severndroog Folly</u>
>Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Severndroog Folly. Professor Strahd von Zarovich stares down at London sprawling before him. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness. Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands.

>Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far away, though not beyond his ken, a party of investigators has just entered his territory. Strahd's face forms a twisted smile; he knew they were coming, and he knows why they have come - all according to his plan. He, the master of the London Underworld, will attend to them.
>
>Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle's towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind, or perhaps a pack of unruly dogs, fills the midnight air. The master of the Underworld is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.
