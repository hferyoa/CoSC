>[!cite] <u>Preamble</u>
>You have all experienced strange dreams of a woman, her voice rasping behind a darkened veil. She speaks in riddles, and whispers in tongues. With each passing night, her words - or the meaning behind them - bore into your psyche. They consume every waking thought, and you find yourself longing for the next night, to hear the next monologue of friends, foes, and birth rights lost to time.
