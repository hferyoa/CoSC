- [[Morgana Haigtess|Morgana]], a hag in the guise of an old woman, has come to Romford from the [[Ol' Bonemill]] to sell her dream pastries for Â£10 apiece. She goes from house to house, knocking on doors. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, Morgana tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday London life. If the characters shadow her for a while, she collects payment form one household in the form of a seven-year-old boy named Lucian Jones. Lucian's mother pleads with Morgana not to take her boy, but Lucian's father snatches the crying child and hands him to the old lady.
