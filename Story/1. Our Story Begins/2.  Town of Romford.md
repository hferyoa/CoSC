> [!tip] I, Strahd: Memoirs of a Vampyr
> _Same voice, same face, same graceful body, she was Tatyana come back to life again. I was absolutely witless from astonishment._
> \- Strahd von Zarovich

The Town of Romford is the saddest place in the land, its residents so terrified of gang violence that they rarely venture from their homes. The village lies in the shadow of London, buried under mist but still unable to hide from the vampyr's sight.

Until recently, the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Professor]] had been paying nightly visits to Irene Kempe, the adopted daughter of the town's mayor. Irene carries the soul of Strahd's beloved Tatyana and looks exactly like her. Strahd intends to make Irene his bride, turn her in to a vampyr, and lock her away in the castle crypts for all time.

> Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds everything. The muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognisable as town houses. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness. No sound cuts the silence except for [[The Case of the Missing Girl|mournful sobbing]] that echoes through the streets from a distance.
